# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Purpose:

  To use machine learning models and algorithms to predict credit risk. A dataset form lenidng club was used for analysis and to trian the models. Two machine learning models were used and four algorithms. 

  ML Models:
    Balance Random Forest Classifier
    Easy Ensemble Classifier
    
  Alogrithms
    SMOTE - Over Sampler
    Random Over Sampler - Over Sampler
    Cluster Centroids - Under Sampler
    SMOTE Combo - Over Sampler & Under Sampler
    
Analysis:

  SMOTE: 
    - High Risk category had a 1% precision score with a recall of 63%.
    - Low Risk category had a 100% precision score with a recall of 69%.
    - Overall category had a 99% precision score with a recall of 69%.

  Random Oversampling
    - High Risk category had a 1% precision score with a recall of 63%.
    - Low Risk category had a 100% precision score with a recall of 61%.
    - Overall category had a 99% precision score with a recall of 61%.
